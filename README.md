The Haunted Journey

The Haunted Journey is a text-based adventure game where players must choose between three distinct paths—Graveyard, Woods, and Crypt—each fraught with danger and discovery. As they progress, players will face unique weather conditions, puzzles, and encounter item rewards based on their chosen class: Warrior, Mage, or Archer. Your choices shape the course of your journey, and only one path leads to the King, waiting at the castle.
