The path to the castle, where the King awaits your presence, is shrouded in mystery. Ahead of you, three distinct paths beckon, each fraught with danger and discovery.
To your left lies the **Graveyard**, its towering tombstones and twisted trees casting long shadows. A chilling breeze whispers through the old stone, telling tales of those long forgotten.
The middle path, the **Woods**, is dense with ancient trees, their gnarled roots entangling the ground like the fingers of the dead. Strange noises drift from within, and the scent of pine and earth fills the air.
To the right, the **Crypt** stands foreboding, its stone archway darkened by the overgrowth of moss and vines. Legends speak of forgotten treasures buried deep within, though many who sought them never returned.
Only one path can lead you to the King, but which one will you choose?"""
